    <h1>A Few Recent Sites</h1>

<h2>My wedding site</h2>

<p>On the afternoon of May 14 2016 I married the best woman I&#8217;ve ever met. The day blurred by in a crazy race from breakfast with my parents to last-minute shirt emergencies to crying everywhere to a hundred hugs to unprecedented happiness. And when it was done the two expenses I was least convinced on proved to be the best: the wedding planner and the photographer.</p>

<p>My lady organized most of the event but she tasked me with <a href="http://wedding.richardmavis.info/">the website</a>. We used Honeyfund for the presents. For the invitation/guest information I looked into The Knot but it ended up being easier to make what I wanted myself than to navigate their UI.</p>

<h2>Wedding photos</h2>

<p>And four months later we put together a collection of <a href="http://weddingphotos.richardmavis.info/">our wedding photos</a>.</p>

<h2>Brooks Cashbaugh dot com</h2>

<p>I met <a href="http://brookscashbaugh.com/">Brooks Cashbaugh</a> back when I was running <a href="/gigantic">Gigantic</a>. I&#8217;m a big fan of his work and it was fun to build this little site for him.</p>

<h2>Sam &amp; Mandy Talking Movies</h2>

<p>My lady and her friend started <a href="http://samandmandytalkingmovies.com/">a movies podcast</a>, so of course I got roped into being their &#8220;tech guy&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Search the KJV</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://kjv.richardmavis.info/">a web interface</a> to the <a href="/the-king-james-in-fire-flames">tool I wrote</a> to search for terms in the King James Version.</p>
