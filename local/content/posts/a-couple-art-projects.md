# A Couple Art Projects


So I've recently revised and expanded a few art projects.


## 42 Love Haiku

_[42 Love Haiku][book]_ is now a book. It's perfect-bound, pocket-sized, and lovely.

## Malevich

And [here's a page][mal] for randomly-generated, [Malevich][malevich]-inspired images. Here's the [source code][github], if you're into that sort of thing.
