# A Few Recent Sites


## My wedding site

On the afternoon of May 14 2016 I married the best woman I've ever met. The day blurred by in a crazy race from breakfast with my parents to last-minute shirt emergencies to crying everywhere to a hundred hugs to unprecedented happiness. And when it was done the two expenses I was least convinced on proved to be the best: the wedding planner and the photographer.

My lady organized most of the event but she tasked me with [the website][invite]. We used Honeyfund for the presents. For the invitation/guest information I looked into The Knot but it ended up being easier to make what I wanted myself than to navigate their UI.


## Wedding photos

And four months later we put together a collection of [our wedding photos][photos].


## Brooks Cashbaugh dot com

I met [Brooks Cashbaugh][brooks] back when I was running [Gigantic][gigantic]. I'm a big fan of his work and it was fun to build this little site for him.


## Sam &amp; Mandy Talking Movies

My lady and her friend started [a movies podcast][movies], so of course I got roped into being their "tech guy".


## Search the KJV

Here's [a web interface][kjv] to the [tool I wrote][kjff] to search for terms in the King James Version.
