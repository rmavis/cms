**Currently** I'm working for [Airtype][airtype], a design and development studio with offices in Winston-Salem, NC, and Portland, OR. I mostly make websites, like [this one][fidel]. In my downtime, I make other things.

After a six-and-a-half year run with Sente Inc., DBA MasterPlans, I left them on **10 October 2014**. It was emotional. While there, I wrote a number of client and internal sites from scratch, front to back. I made clickable many site designs and redesigns of scales big and small, some of which were actually made live and are still in use. I remade [MasterPlans.com][mp], which was originally written in India, about five times. I designed and implemented a system for tracking sales leads, collating and prioritizing inputs from an array of sources. I created, maintain, and continuously expand and refine a combination customer relationship management + project management system. I wrote a nifty and fashionable employee forum. I wrote a flush poker game. I designed and laid out a few business plans in InDesign, which were probably printed and look nice on paper. And so on.

The fifth Big Busk happened on **19 July 2014**, 358 days after the fourth. There was a nine-person ukulele punk band, a band visiting from Eugene, and our afterparty was at Kelly's Olympian.

Our [second anniversary at Gigantic][cdv2], **7 March 2013**, was much like the first but hugely better. We spent two nights just drawing the grid guidelines on the walls. We hung over 300 pieces of tiny art and we sold more the night of the opening than at any show prior. It was glorious. And just under two months later, **30 April 2013**, we moved out.

The fourth Big Busk happened on **28 July 2012**, about one year and one week after the third. We tried a couple different things with this one. One, it was a week after the usual day in mid-July. Two, I built a handy system that allowed the musicians to sign up for the slots they wanted themselves. The afterparty was at Backspace. And we finally got a [SoundCloud][bbsc] account.

To celebrate our first anniversary at Gigantic, we decided to celebrate the artists we met and enjoyed working with. We invited them to make as many 4" x 6" [*cartes de visite*][cdv] as they wanted. In the week leading up to **1 March 2012** we hung nearly 200 pieces&mdash;far too many with push pins&mdash;and we sold a good number of them that night.

The third Big Busk happened on **16 July 2011**, nearly one year to the day after the second. A morning rain canceled the earlier acts but the rest of the event went swimmingly, involving [swing dancers][bbswing], [Thoth][], and an afterparty at the [White Eagle][whitee].

Shannon Larson, [Jon Rossitto][jr] and I combined our love of long hours, thankless toil, planning, parties and folly into the Art Leviathan that is [Gigantic Gallery][gg]&mdash;one of the smallest galleries you're ever likely to see&mdash;and made our big debut on **3 March 2011**.

The second Big Busk happened on **17 July 2010**, nearly one year to the day after the first. About 35 bands played in various spots around downtown between noon and 9 p.m. [The Oregonian kindly documented the event][theo] which, in part, made us decide to hold it annually.

[The Big Busk][bigbusk] happened on **18 July 2009** after a solid six weeks of preparation. It was fun for most of us and some of us made a decent amount of money. By "us" I mean "them", of course, because I am not a musician. I made no money at all. But I did make a couple pretty excellent contacts.

In **May 2008** 15 of my collages, enlarged and framed, were allegedly shown at Art Six Coffee House in Denton, TX.

In late **January 2008** I moved to Portland, OR. After sending out resumes constantly for two weeks I (1) was offered three jobs on the same day, and (2) immediately quit grammar-correcting texts for that Ukrainian dating site.

**November 2007**, while staying with a friend in Denton, TX, I holed up for a week to write [Seedy Stories][seedy]. It received a little write-up on John McGrath's blog Errata on Wordie.org, which appears to have been since consumed by or otherwise merged with [Wordnik.com][wordnik]. I've kind of abandoned it. I'll get back to it someday.

I spent **September 2007** at my parents' house writing a database/content management system, primarily because I was sick of using PHPMyAdmin, and secondarily because a month is a long time to stay with one's parents when you're 25 and eager to see more of the world, and I had to pass the time somehow.

Back in Long Beach after a month of travel, **August 2007**, I finished Meanwhile in Long Beach, a community photo-sharing timeline, which is no longer live. So it goes.

[Bimbo Gun][bg], a bizarre little book with a tantalizing cover, was produced at [Naropa University][naropa], and included one of my poems.

I planned on quitting on the first of **May 2007**, [May Day][mayday] to pagans and certain Europeans, but actually quit a week after that.

In **January 2007** I took a night class on Unix at UCLA and earned an A+.

[Cecil Touchon][touchon] of [The International Museum of Collage, Assemblage and Construction][collagem] included some of the collages I sent him in the first international [Fluxhibition][fluxi], which sadly never came to Long Beach.

Over the **summer of 2006**, to learn PHP, MySQL, Javascript and all that, I wrote the first version of acycle.org, which was lost a year later when [my hosting company suddenly disappeared][jatol].

In the **spring of 2006** I taught myself how to do cool things with Perl and XML, and in so doing was able to automate most of my tasks at work, both those I was assigned and those I invented.

**15 August 2005** was my first day working for the [IEEE Computer Society][ieee]. I was hired to prepare images for publication in journals and on the web. We managed nine titles. I slowly expanded my role.

Two of my collages were printed in the 31st issue of Analecta.

I lived with my parents during the **summer of 2005**. While not heedlessly sending out resumes [I worked as a journalist][vvq] for the Valley Voice newspaper, which is no longer live. They put my first story on the front page. But even though I loved writing for the paper I took the first "real job" I was offered. Because a summer really is too long a time to live with one's parents when you're 22 and anxious to get on with your life. And so I moved to Long Beach, CA.

In **May 2005** I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in English and a fair GPA. To commemorate the achievement I shaved my head&mdash;or, it was (partly) shaved for me (against my will)&mdash;and delayed the panic by going to New York City for a little vacation.

I worked on the staff of [Analecta][utlit], UT's literary/arts journal, as (first year) reader and (second year) editor. Scott Pierce of Effing Press (no longer live) and Travis Castull of [Haggard and Halloo][hh] printed some poems of mine in their respective magazines. And I built a couple sites, one for Scott and another for a photographer. Neither are still up. So it goes.

I left St Mary's University in San Antonio for the last time in **May 2003**. And in **August 2003** I moved to Austin to attend the University of Texas there.

I worked on The Pecan Grove Review, St Mary's literary journal, as a decider of some import. Eric Cruz moved to Austin and left me his Society of Writers and Poets, so I became the president of it. And I worked on The Rattler, the campus newspaper, during the year that we nearly lost our funding and our sponsor due to certain liberties taken by the editor-in-chief. It was fun.

In **August 2001** I left home and went with gusto to St Mary's University in San Antonio (they offered to cover half of my expenses) with the ambition of double-majoring in Business and what they called English Communication Arts. My first business class was in the spring semester. It started at 7 a.m. and the professor seemed oddly obsessed with shaking hands "web to web". I dropped the business major.

**1994&ndash;2001**: high school, middle school, and related adolescent atrocities.

The day that O.J. Simpson led police on a little chase around LA, **17 June 1994**, we finished packing and moved to Highland Village, TX, just down the street from Flower Mound, TX. Seriously. I cried.

**1982&ndash;1994**: Catholic school, Calvin & Hobbes, BMX bikes, pink houses.

I guess I've always been a night person: at **1:59 a.m., 3 September 1982**, I was brought gleefully into the world by caring hands in Visalia, CA.
