# What I'm Doing Now

I wrote [a book of haiku][42lovehaiku] and I'm working on getting it onto shelves and into your hands.

I'm writing a novel.

I'm writing a book about programming.

I'm thinking about starting an art-based charity/non-profit with a friend.

I'm making websites and stuff for [Airtype][airtype].

I'm writing [little code projects][github] as the inspiration hits and then failing to post them.

I'm reading Friedrich Nietzsche and Aldous Huxley. I'm listening to Morton Feldman and Flying Lotus.

I got [married][wedding] last year and now I'm planning our honeymoon.

I'm living in Portland, OR. I'm commuting by bike. I'm wearing cardigans and skinny jeans.

This is my [now][nownownow] page.
