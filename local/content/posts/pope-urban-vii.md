# Pope Urban VII

This site is running on a little collection of Ruby scripts that I'm currently calling [Pope Urban VII][wiki]. There are many [static site generators][ssg] but this one is mine.

**So why write another one?** Mostly because I wanted to. When you build your own computer tools you're limited only by your abilities, and the act of building something expands your abilities. Also because I didn't like little things about the others that I looked into.

**Why Pope Urban VII?** Mostly because his name contains the letters "u" and "rb" in succession. This project began its life in a file called `u.rb`. But also because his is an interesting little papacy.

**Can you get it?** Not yet&mdash;you wouldn't want it until it's done anyway.
