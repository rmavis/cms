# R&eacute;sum&eacute;


## Some things I've built
- A combination [Customer Relations Management + Project Management System][mp]
- A combination gallery and event guide on a map and its admin tools
- An employee forum (two, actually)
- A [simple site management tool][higgs]
- A [less simple site management tool][purb] (on which this site is running)
- A command line tool for [storing and browsing text snippets][star]
- A command line tool for [culling and collating verses from the KJV][kjv]
- A blogging platform (two, actually) and accompanying text-to-HTML converters, one of which also converted HTML back to plain text
- A website for a [summer music festival][bigbusk] and an accompanying multi-dimensional gig scheduler
- A website for a [tiny art gallery][gig] and all its accompanying tools
- A [literary/arts journal][acycle] and all its accompanying tools
- An [idea generator for writers][seedy], which is in bad need of repair
- And various other tools and sites too embarrassing or broken to show

And I post a few projects in varying stages of completion on [github][github].


## Languages and tools I know
I regularly use JavaScript (and Angular, Node, gulp, etc), Ruby, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS/SASS, Git, OS X and Linux, Craft CMS, InDesign and Photoshop and their free counterparts, etc.

I have a decent familiarity with Go, Perl (my first language), PostgreSQL and SQLite, FreeBSD, and WordPress.

I have some familiarity with Swift and iOS development. I can read and revise some Java.

I would love to write more [Racket][racket].

The first two programs I install on a new machine are emacs and [fish][fish].


## Some books I've read

I'm self-taught as a programmer, which means I read a lot of books. Some of my favorites are:

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp]
- [The Little Schemer][schemer]
- [The Pragmatic Programmer][pragprog]
- [JavaScript: The Good Parts][jstgp]
- [Beginning Perl][perl], which was my first
- [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby][why], which started a genre


## Places I've worked
<ul>
<li class="blocky"><strong><a href="//airtype.com">Airtype Studio</a></strong><br />
From October 2014 until today<br />
As a senior developer. I build websites for clients, design and implement APIs, customize CMSes, revise legacy projects, review everyone's code, help onboard the new hires, form and document our current and best practices, and occasionally communicate with clients. I also started our book club and a weekly project/koan routine.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong>Sente, Inc. dba <a href="//www.masterplans.com">MasterPlans</a></strong><br />
From February 2008 until October 2014<br />
As the all-around web guy: designing and building our internal systems, building our site, building sites for clients, setting up servers, etc.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong>On the road</strong><br />
From May 2007 until January 2008<br />
Freelancing. It's fun until you need to pay bills.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong><a href="//www.computer.org">IEEE Computer Society</a></strong><br />
From August 2005 until May 2007<br />
As an "electronic media assistant". We published 9 titles online and in print. I prepared a variety of files—mostly XML, HTML, and images—for publication. I also taught myself Perl.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong>The Valley Voice Newspaper</strong><br />
During the summer of 2005<br />
I interviewed people and wrote stories, took pictures, all that stuff. Journalism is fun.</li>
</ul>


## Places I've gone to school
<ul>
<li class="blocky"><strong>University of Texas at Austin</strong><br />
From August 2003 until May 2005<br />
I got a BA in English. I worked on the campus literary/arts journal and was also in the National Society of Collegiate Scholars.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong>St. Mary's University, San Antonio</strong><br />
From August 2001 until May 2003<br />
There was a program that combined literature with media production called Electronic Communication Arts. I did that for two years. I also worked for the campus newspaper, literary journal, and the English Department. They gave me a pretty good scholarship.</li>
</ul>
