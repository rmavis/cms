# Seedy Stories

I wrote [Seedy Stories][ss] in a few days in a coffee shop in Denton, TX. The idea was to make something akin to Brian Eno's [Oblique Strategies][os] but more tailored for writers&mdash;a prompt or set of constraints aimed at generating ideas.

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-2.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" /></div>

Clicking the "draw" button draws the number and type of "seeds" specified by the form.

<div class="img-block">
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-3.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" />
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-4.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" />
</div>

The checkbox by each question toggles the visibility of that column.

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-5.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" /></div>

John McGrath, who made Wordie.org, which has since merged with or been consumed by [Wordnik.com][wordnik], wrote a little blog post about it&mdash;noting that our designs both used Palatino. And a user named CherryDaiquiri wrote to me and called it "the most non-boring thing on the internet".

But it's since fallen into disrepair. I still like the idea. I don't know. Maybe the next time I find myself in Denton I'll refresh it, rework the design a little, rebrand it in the fashion of [WTFSIMFD][].
