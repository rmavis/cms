# Something Like Whale Shark Skin

A few nights ago we were eating dinner at a restaurant that was playing one of those zen-out ocean movies on the wall. A few of the segments involved whale sharks and I was reminded of how much I like the pattern on their skin.

</div>

So I wrote a little [Javascript][github] that creates an image-in-code that looks something like it. [Check it out][rm]. Refresh the page a couple times.

Part of what I love about whale shark skin is that the pattern reminds me of the look of plant cells.

<div class="img-block">

  <div class="image-caption">via <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-a-plant-cell">Quora</a></div>
</div>

And I think it's hilarious that the world's largest fish looks a little like it's covered in tiny plant parts.
