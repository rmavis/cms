# Screen Snow

In celebration of the best snowpocalypse Portland has had in at least eight years, [here's some snow][snow] for your screen. There's no animation or music or any other corny thing&mdash;it's made using a little script that creates [random star patterns][stars], with the parameters set just so.

Each time you refresh it you'll get a new image unique as a snowflake, unique as you.
