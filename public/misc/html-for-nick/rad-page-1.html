<h1>This is rad</h1>


<h2>Portland is also rad</h2>

<p>Howdy. Have you ever visited Portland? If not, you should.</p>

<p>Why? Because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We ride bikes</li>
	<li>We have good food</li>
	<li>Powell's Books is awesome</li>
	<li>Sometimes schools close for "bad weather" when it's actually sunny and warm outside</li>
</ul>


<h3>A bunch of bridges</h3>

<p>There are lot of bridges in this town. From north to south:</p>

<ol>
	<li>St. Johns Bridge</li>
	<li>Ross Island Bridge</li>
	<li>Fremont Bridge</li>
	<li>Broadway Bridge</li>
	<li>Steel Bridge</li>
	<li>Burnside Bridge</li>
	<li>Morrison Bridge</li>
	<li>Hawthorne Bridge</li>
	<li>Marquam Bridge</li>
	<li>Ross Island Bridge</li>
	<li>Sellwood Bridge</li>
</ol>

<p>And we're getting a pedestrian- and bike-only bridge! It's currently under construction but should be complete in 2014.</p>


<h2>Hyper-strength haiku</h2>

<p>Do you like haiku?</p>

I left the chowder
on the window ledge too long.
Cold soup. Cold winter.
