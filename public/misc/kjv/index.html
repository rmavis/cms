<h1 var="decl">The King James in <span class="color" var="fire">Fire</span> &amp; <span class="color" var="flame">Flames</span></h1>




<h1 var="testament">The Old Testament of the King James Version of the Bible</h1>
<h1>The First Book of Moses:  Called Genesis</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">19:25</span> Then the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> from the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> out of heaven;</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:7</span> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:8</span> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</p>
<h1>The Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:3</span> And the angel of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> appeared unto him in a <span class="color" var="flame">flame</span> of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and the bush was not consumed.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:24</span> And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> sent thunder and hail, and the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> ran along upon the ground; and the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:25</span> So there was hail, and <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">12:9</span> And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">12:10</span> Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">12:11</span> And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:22</span> And the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, to give them light; to go by day and night:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">14:1</span> He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> by night, from before the people.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">14:25</span> And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">19:19</span> And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> descended upon it in <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:7</span> If <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> shall surely make restitution.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">24:18</span> And the sight of the glory of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> was like devouring <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">27:4</span> And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his <span class="color" var="fire">firepans</span>: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:15</span> But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> without the camp: it is a sin offering.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:19</span> And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:26</span> And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it is an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:35</span> And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:42</span> And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">30:21</span> When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">32:21</span> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">32:25</span> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and there came out this calf.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">35:4</span> Ye shall kindle no <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">38:4</span> And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the <span class="color" var="fire">firepans</span>: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">40:38</span> For the cloud of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> was upon the tabernacle by day, and <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>
<h1>The Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:8</span> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:9</span> And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> which is upon the altar:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:10</span> But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:13</span> And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> which is upon the altar:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:14</span> But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:1</span> And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:3</span> And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:4</span> And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:10</span> And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:11</span> And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:12</span> No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:15</span> And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, even corn beaten out of full ears.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:1</span> And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:4</span> And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:6</span> And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: it is an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:10</span> And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:12</span> And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:15</span> And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:17</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> for a sweet savour: all the fat is the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>'s.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:13</span> Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:1</span> And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:13</span> Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it is a sin offering.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:10</span> Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> of the altar shall be burning in it.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:11</span> And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:13</span> And the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:14</span> The <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:18</span> It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:19</span> All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:1</span> And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:6</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it is a trespass offering.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:18</span> But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:20</span> And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:26</span> For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:31</span> His own hands shall bring the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:36</span> This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> in the priest's office;</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">8:18</span> But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> without the camp; as the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">8:22</span> And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; as the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">8:29</span> And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">8:33</span> And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:12</span> And the flesh and the hide he burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> without the camp.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:1</span> And there came a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> out from before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:2</span> And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, which he commanded them not.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:3</span> And there went out <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> from the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and devoured them, and they died before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:13</span> And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:14</span> And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: for so I am commanded.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:16</span> The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> hath commanded.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:53</span> He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:56</span> And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:58</span> And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:13</span> And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> from off the altar before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:14</span> And he shall put the incense upon the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:28</span> And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:22</span> And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span>: I am the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">19:7</span> It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">20:15</span> And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:7</span> They shall be holy unto their <span class="color" var="god">God</span>, and not profane the name of their <span class="color" var="god">God</span>: for the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and the bread of their <span class="color" var="god">God</span>, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:10</span> And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:22</span> No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his <span class="color" var="god">God</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:23</span> Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, nor make an offering by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> of them upon the altar unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:28</span> When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">23:9</span> But ye shall offer an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">23:14</span> And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">23:19</span> And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">23:28</span> Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">23:37</span> Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>

<h1>The Fourth Book of Moses:  Called Numbers</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">3:5</span> And Nadab and Abihu died before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, when they offered strange <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:19</span> And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:16</span> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, until the morning.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:17</span> So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> by night.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:2</span> And when the people complained, it displeased the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: and the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:3</span> And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> was quenched.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:4</span> And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> burnt among them.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">14:15</span> And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> art among this people, that thou <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> by night.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:4</span> And will make an offering by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, of the herd or of the flock:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:11</span> And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:14</span> All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:15</span> And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; as ye do, so he shall do.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:26</span> And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and their sin offering before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, for their ignorance:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:8</span> And put <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> therein, and put incense in them before the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:19</span> And they took every man his censer, and put <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:36</span> And there came out a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> from the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:38</span> Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> yonder; for they are hallowed.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:47</span> And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; the plague is begun.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:10</span> This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:18</span> But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, for a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:29</span> For there is a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> gone out of Heshbon, a <span class="color" var="flame">flame</span> from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">26:11</span> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:3</span> Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:4</span> And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> which ye shall offer unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:7</span> It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:9</span> And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:14</span> And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:20</span> But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> for a burnt offering unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">28:25</span> After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:7</span> Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:14</span> And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">29:37</span> But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of a sweet savour unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">31:11</span> And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>

<h1>The Fifth Book of Moses:  Called Deuteronomy</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:34</span> Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:12</span> And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:13</span> And the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> spake unto you out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:16</span> Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:25</span> For the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span> is a consuming <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, even a jealous <span class="color" var="god">God</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:34</span> Did ever people hear the voice of <span class="color" var="god">God</span> speaking out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, as thou hast heard, and live?</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:37</span> Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:5</span> The <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>,</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:6</span> (I stood between the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> and you at that time, to shew you the word of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: for ye were afraid by reason of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and went not up into the mount;) saying,</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:23</span> These words the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:24</span> And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:25</span> And ye said, Behold, the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> our <span class="color" var="god">God</span> hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: we have seen this day that <span class="color" var="god">God</span> doth talk with man, and he liveth.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:26</span> Now therefore why should we die? for this great <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> will consume us: if we hear the voice of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> our <span class="color" var="god">God</span> any more, then we shall die.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:27</span> For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living <span class="color" var="god">God</span> speaking out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, as we have, and lived?</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:6</span> But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:26</span> The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:4</span> Understand therefore this day, that the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span> is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> hath said unto thee.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:11</span> And the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of <span class="color" var="god">God</span>; and on them was written according to all the words, which the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in the day of the assembly.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:16</span> So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:22</span> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:5</span> And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in the day of the assembly: and the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> gave them unto me.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">12:4</span> And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">12:32</span> Thou shalt not do so unto the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span>: for every abomination to the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> to their gods.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:17</span> And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span>: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:2</span> The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and his inheritance.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:11</span> There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:17</span> According to all that thou desiredst of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> thy <span class="color" var="god">God</span> in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> my <span class="color" var="god">God</span>, neither let me see this great <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> any more, that I die not.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">32:23</span> For a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> the foundations of the mountains.</p>
<h1>The Book of Joshua</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:25</span> And they burnt the city with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:16</span> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:26</span> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, after they had stoned them with stones.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">8:9</span> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: according to the commandment of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">8:20</span> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:7</span> And the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:10</span> And Joshua did unto them as the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:12</span> And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:15</span> Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> <span class="color" var="god">God</span> of Israel made by <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> are their inheritance, as he said unto them.</p>
<h1>The Book of Judges</h1>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:9</span> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:22</span> Then the angel of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> departed out of his sight.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:16</span> And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:21</span> But if not, let <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:50</span> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">9:53</span> And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">12:2</span> And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">13:21</span> For it came to pass, when the <span class="color" var="flame">flame</span> went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> ascended in the <span class="color" var="flame">flame</span> of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">14:16</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:5</span> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took <span class="color" var="fire">firebrands</span>, and turned tail to tail, and put a <span class="color" var="fire">firebrand</span> in the midst between two tails.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:6</span> And when he had set the brands on <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:15</span> Wherefore thus saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> <span class="color" var="god">God</span> of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:2</span> O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">6:30</span> The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">7:32</span> And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">11:17</span> The <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:15</span> And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:1</span> But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">19:6</span> They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:11</span> For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:13</span> O house of David, thus saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:1</span> But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>: and I will kindle a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">22:8</span> And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">32:30</span> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">32:36</span> And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">34:3</span> Thus saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, the <span class="color" var="god">God</span> of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">35:1</span> Behold, I will command, saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">36:23</span> Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> on the hearth burning before him.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">36:24</span> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> that was on the hearth.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">37:1</span> Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">37:9</span> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">37:11</span> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">38:18</span> Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, the <span class="color" var="god">God</span> of hosts, the <span class="color" var="god">God</span> of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">38:19</span> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">38:24</span> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">39:9</span> And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">43:13</span> And I will kindle a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">44:1</span> He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">48:46</span> They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a <span class="color" var="flame">flame</span> from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">49:3</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">49:28</span> And I will kindle a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">50:33</span> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">51:33</span> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and the men of war are affrighted.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">51:59</span> Thus saith the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and they shall be weary.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">52:14</span> And burned the house of the <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span>, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>:</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">52:20</span> And the basons, and the <span class="color" var="fire">firepans</span>, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.</p>
<h1>The Lamentations of Jeremiah</h1>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:4</span> He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, which devoureth round about.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">2:5</span> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">4:12</span> The <span class="color" var="lord">LORD</span> hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:14</span> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> was bright, and out of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> went forth lightning.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">1:28</span> And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and it had brightness round about.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:3</span> Thou shalt burn with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">5:5</span> Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and burn them in the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; for thereof shall a <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> come forth into all the house of Israel.</p>

And he went in in my sight.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:7</span> And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">10:8</span> And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:5</span> Behold, it is cast into the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> for fuel; the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:6</span> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> hath devoured it, and it is burned?</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">14:19</span> And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">15:3</span> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of <span class="color" var="god">God</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">16:9</span> And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>

<p><span class="color" var="vn">18:9</span> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>: for strong is the <span class="color" var="lord">Lord</span> <span class="color" var="god">God</span> who judgeth her.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">19:13</span> His eyes were as a <span class="color" var="flame">flame</span> of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">19:21</span> And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> burning with brimstone.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">20:10</span> And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> came down from <span class="color" var="god">God</span> out of heaven, and devoured them.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">20:11</span> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">20:15</span> And death and hell were cast into the lake of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>. This is the second death.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:1</span> And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color" var="vn">21:9</span> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with <span class="color" var="fire">fire</span> and brimstone: which is the second death.</p>
