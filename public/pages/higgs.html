    <h1>Higgs</h1>

<p>Greg Higgins, an artist I met through <a href="http://giganticgallery.info/">Gigantic</a>, wanted to commission me to build a site for him. Having made a few client sites while working for <a href="http://www.masterplans.com/">MasterPlans</a>, I knew he&#8217;d want:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ability to create and delete pages</li>
<li>the ability to edit the content on those pages</li>
<li>the ability to rearrange the order of those pages in the nav bar</li>
<li>the ability to upload images and swap out his main logo</li>
<li>the ability to do all these things himself, but also</li>
<li>the ability to holler at me if he got frustrated</li>
</ul>

<p>And if I was going to build this for him, I&#8217;d want the system to be eminently self-explanatory and insanely easy to use so that he would have no foreseeable reason to get frustrated and holler at me.</p>

<p>So I built Higgs. It&#8217;s a one-page web app for building a simple site.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-overview.png" alt="Admin overview." /></div>

<p>The primary goal was of course to make an awesome site-building tool for my client. And the secondary goal was to build a tool that I could easily replicate and repurpose for other people that might want similar.</p>

<p>Greg liked the look of the <a href="http://serendipitywinerack.info/">Serendipity Wine Rack</a> site that I built for my friend Jon Rossitto. So the output of the admin system would be pages that looked similar: nav on top, a big header, big images, and text beneath that.</p>

<p>So the admin login is {domain}/admin.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-login.png" alt="Admin login." /></div>

<p>The page scales down well.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="smallblock" src="/images/higgs/admin-login-phone.png" alt="Admin login on small screens." /></div>

<p>The whole system does.</p>

<div class="img-block">
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-page.png" alt="Admin page editing on larger screens." />
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-menu-phone.png" alt="Admin page menu on small screens." />
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-page-phone.png" alt="Admin page editing on small screens." />
</div>

<p>Greg wanted the option to use images for the top nav links. Hence the &#8220;logo goes here&#8221; filler image&mdash;clicking that triggers the image upload form and the newly-uploaded logo replaces that. The image upload script makes copies of each image at multiple sizes and uses a baby bear size for the nav image, a mama bear size for the admin panel, and the papa bear size for the public page.</p>

<p>The page URLs are sanitized versions of the page titles. So the URL for &#8220;KissKill Bags&#8221; is {domain}/kisskill-bags.</p>

<p>Each page&#8217;s images are accessed by clicking the &#8220;images&#8221; header. A plus sign appears in-line, with thumbnails of each image beneath that.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-images.png" alt="Admin image uploads on larger screens." /></div>

<p>Clicking the plus, as with the &#8220;logo goes here&#8221;, triggers the image upload form. Newly-uploaded images are added to the bank beneath the header.</p>

<p>Clicking the image&#8217;s thumbnail toggles its larger version and a text area for its caption.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-image-caption.png" alt="Admin image caption editing on small screens." /></div>

<p>The dropdown beneath each image (and beneath the page&#8217;s main textarea) allows you to mark that image (or that page) as hidden or public, or to delete it.</p>

<p>Similarly, when mousing over an image thumbnail, or a page title in the sidebar, a pound sign appears.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-page-rearrange.png" alt="Admin page rearranging on larger screens." /></div>

<p>You can click and drag the pound sign handles to reorder the images and the pages. The order shown is reflected on the public site.</p>

<p>The <strong>home page</strong> on top is different. It cannot be retitled, hidden, deleted, or reordered to a lower position. It has the same &#8220;logo goes here&#8221; and main text area as every other page, but its image list is built from the public images of the other pages.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/admin-home-image-list.png" alt="Admin home page image editing on larger screens." /></div>

<p>Selected images&mdash;those at full opacity and with a thick green border&mdash;appear on the home page.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/home-page.png" alt="Home page on larger screens." /></div>

<p>The captions of images on the home page link to the pages they represent.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/higgs/example-page-body.png" alt="Example page on larger screens." /></div>

<p>And of course the pages scale down well too.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg smallblock" src="/images/higgs/example-page-phone.png" alt="Example page on smaller screens." /></div>

<p>Greg is still working on the content for his site, so it&#8217;s not ready to show yet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my friend Jon Rossitto asked if I&#8217;d build a site for him, so I gave him a modified Higgs. He&#8217;s also working on his content, and it&#8217;s coming along nicely. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://jon.richardmavis.info/">a preview of the result</a>. It&#8217;s loaded primarily with filler content but you can see the idea.</p>
