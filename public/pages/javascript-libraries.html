<p>Here are some Javascript libraries I&#8217;ve written.</p>

<h4 id="http.jshttp"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/http">Http.js</a></h4>

<p>For managing AJAX requests.</p>

<h4 id="clattr.jsclattr"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/clattr">Clattr.js</a></h4>

<p>For managing element attributes.</p>

<h4 id="alert.jsalert"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/alert">Alert.js</a></h4>

<p>For managing good-looking, high-functioning alerts and notifications.</p>

<h4 id="scrollmonitor.jsscrollmonitor"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/scrollmonitor">ScrollMonitor.js</a></h4>

<p>For monitoring and responding to a user&#8217;s scroll position.</p>

<h4 id="informer.jsinformer"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/informer">Informer.js</a></h4>

<p>For better handling of forms and their data.</p>

<h4 id="monopage.jsmonopage"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/monopage">Monopage.js</a></h4>

<p>For correlating URLs and element states on a single-page site.</p>

<h4 id="utils.jsutils"><a href="https://github.com/rmavis/utils.js">Utils.js</a></h4>

<p>Miscellaneous utility functions.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>I think frameworks are a poor investment <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=frameworks%20vs%20libraries">for all the usual reasons</a>: the skills required to effectively use a framework are typically framework-specific and therefore non-transferable, and they are subject to obsolescence by the framework&#8217;s developers; frameworks are projects that will likely change must faster than the language they&#8217;re written in and, as some wise man once said, only a fool would build a house on sand; they create bloat (every function a user downloads that is not used is bloat); they encourage dependence rather than self-reliance; etc. For many reasons, libraries are a better investment, a better development pattern, and tend to result in a better experience both for the user and for the developer.</p>

<p>So I was sort of upset when the libraries I was writing started relying on other libraries I had written. A great library should be self-contained, self-reliant, limited to one problem set, and easy to replace. But that self-containment can quickly result in repetition, which is A Bad Thing. So, rather than include a copy of a utility function in each library that needed it, I removed them all to <a href="https://github.com/rmavis/utils.js">utils.js</a>.</p>

<p>And some problem sets are just more complex than others: <a href="https://github.com/rmavis/http">http.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rmavis/clattr">clattr.js</a> and simpler and smaller in scale than <a href="https://github.com/rmavis/monopage">monopage.js</a>, which requires the functionality contained in both.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how a set of libraries can become a framework&#8212;what is a framework if not a collection of related, inter-dependent, and hopefully DRY libraries? But there&#8217;s a fundamental difference in the design philosophy: one is monolithic and maybe allows for modular components, the other <em>is only modular components</em> and you can use them however you want.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m lazy, and I&#8217;m pretty stupid, so I&#8217;d rather stick with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">what&#8217;s worked for forty years</a> than keep up with <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/2014/05/zero_framework_manifesto">the framework of the week</a>.</p>
