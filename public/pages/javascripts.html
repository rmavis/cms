<p>Up until about mid&#8211;2014 I never thought much about JavaScript, which is a shame because I&#8217;d written a hell of a lot of it.</p>

<p>But lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about it. In <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/07/18/javascript-isnt-scheme/">this great post</a>, the author describes the sort of developer whose first language was JavaScript and who now, years later, finds himself using it all the time while feeling weirdly ashamed of it. I am that sort of developer. My relationship with JavaScript is <em>it&#8217;s complicated</em>.</p>

<p>Progress has been made. I used to think of JavaScript as a toy language, but since then I&#8217;ve encountered <em>real</em> toy languages, like <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. I&#8217;ve also encountered developers who take these toys very seriously. These days, I think JavaScript is pretty okay.</p>

<p>To reiterate the post above: JavaScript is not Scheme. But JavaScript has many Scheme-like aspects, and it was Scheme that made me rethink my whole position on JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>

<p>You could argue that jQuery is not a language, it&#8217;s a framework, and you would be right. But if you&#8217;ve ever searched for help on a certain problem in JavaScript and abandoned all hope of finding the solution after poring through eight pages of references to jQuery, you&#8217;ve seen how one might get confused.</p>

<p>I never learned jQuery mostly because it never seemed like a wise investment. Frameworks in general seem like an unwise investment, both the time spent learning the framework and as a long-term base for a project. A framework itself is a project&#8212;it will expand and evolve as any other project does. So if you imagine your website as a house, then the language your code is written in is the foundation. Building your website with a framework, with the way it shifts and changes beneath you, is like building your house on sand. And some wise man once said that only fools build their homes on sand.</p>

<p>You could argue that a language is also a project, subject to the same changes as any other, and you would be right. But languages tend to change at a much slower pace than other projects. Frameworks can be born, become famous, and be forgotten all within one minor-release cycle of a language.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another way to think of frameworks: picture all the JavaScript that runs your site as a bicycle. A framework is a bicycle with no replacable parts, and that monolithic construction was a conscious design decision because a framework is meant to be both self-sufficient and all-encompassing. The value of a framework is determined by the volume of functionality it includes&#8212;by how effectively it minimizes the amount of custom code required to run a project. So you could probably add that bell you really like to the handlebars if you really want to, but there&#8217;s already a bell there, and yours is going to look really weird and out of place.</p>

<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>

<p>When you go shopping for frameworks, you&#8217;re looking at factory-issued bicycles&#8212;row after row of ready-to-ride Surlys and Linuses and Huffys. When you go shopping for libraries, you&#8217;re looking at components&#8212;bin after bin of pedals, handlebars, and inner tubes.</p>

<p>Building a project with a collection of libraries requires more initial work than with a framework. You need to find all the components you like, and then figure out how to connect all those components. But that work is worth it. The result is a thing you know inside and out, a thing that works just as you want it to, and a thing you can change in any way you like.</p>

<p>And libraries allow you to tailor your tools to your needs. When your project only calls for a wheel and a bell, you do not want an entire bicycle.</p>

<p>A well-designed library fits in well and is easily replaced. A well-designed library is self-sufficient but encompasses only one aspect of functionality.</p>

<h2 id="howlibrariesbecomeframeworks">How Libraries Become Frameworks</h2>

<p>So lately I&#8217;ve been writing a few JavaScript libraries. I write them as the need arises. So far I&#8217;ve written libraries for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handling HTTP requests</li>
<li>Manipulating element attributes</li>
<li>Manipulating and submitting form data</li>
<li>Managing page history and caching page state</li>
<li>Collapsing and expanding elements</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping</li>
<li>Slideshows</li>
<li>Overlays</li>
<li>Alerts</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot of functional overlap between these libraries&#8212;basic utility functions that many of them have in common. What I&#8217;ve been doing is, for each project, collecting the common functions into a project-specific <code>Utils</code> library. That library becomes the sole common dependency of the others.</p>

<p>if you didn;t tailot the utils This is how frameworks are formed.</p>
