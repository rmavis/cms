    <h1>One way to think about determinism</h1>

<p>Imagine you&#8217;re an astronaut floating alone through space in a long orbit around the sun.</p>

<p>Now imagine your space suit is equipped with thrusters. By pushing some controls you can change your trajectory. This is soft determinism.</p>

<p>Now instead imagine you have no thrusters, and maybe instead of an astronaut you&#8217;re a sort of self-conscious asteroid. This is hard determinism.</p>
