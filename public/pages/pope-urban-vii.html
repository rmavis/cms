    <h1>Pope Urban VII</h1>

<p>This site is running on a little collection of Ruby scripts that I&#8217;m currently calling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_VII">Pope Urban VII</a>. There are many <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">static site generators</a> but this one is mine.</p>

<p><strong>So why write another one?</strong> Mostly because I wanted to. When you build your own computer tools you&#8217;re limited only by your abilities, and the act of building something expands your abilities. Also because I didn&#8217;t like little things about the others that I looked into.</p>

<p><strong>Why Pope Urban VII?</strong> Mostly because his name contains the letters &#8220;u&#8221; and &#8220;rb&#8221; in succession. This project began its life in a file called <code>u.rb</code>. But also because his is an interesting little papacy.</p>

<p><strong>Can you get it?</strong> Not yet&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t want it until it&#8217;s done anyway.</p>
