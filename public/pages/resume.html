<ul>
<li class="blocky"><strong><a href="//airtype.com">Airtype Studio</a></strong><br />
From October 2014 until today<br />
As a senior developer. I build websites for clients, design and implement APIs, customize CMSes, revise legacy projects, review everyone's code, help onboard the new hires, form and document our current and best practices, and occasionally communicate with clients. I also started our book club and a weekly project/koan routine.</li>

<li class="blocky"><strong>On the road</strong><br />
From May 2007 until January 2008<br />
Freelancing. It's fun until you need to pay bills.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong><a href="//www.computer.org">IEEE Computer Society</a></strong><br />
From August 2005 until May 2007<br />
As an "electronic media assistant". We published 9 titles online and in print. I prepared a variety of files—mostly XML, HTML, and images—for publication. I also taught myself Perl.</li>
<li class="blocky"><strong>The Valley Voice Newspaper</strong><br />
During the summer of 2005<br />
I interviewed people and wrote stories, took pictures, all that stuff. Journalism is fun.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="blocky"><strong>University of Texas at Austin</strong><br />

From August 2001 until May 2003<br />
There was a program that combined literature with media production called Electronic Communication Arts. I did that for two years. I also worked for the campus newspaper, literary journal, and the English Department. They gave me a pretty good scholarship.</li>
