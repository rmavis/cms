    <h1>Seedy Stories</h1>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://seedystories.com/">Seedy Stories</a> in a few days in a coffee shop in Denton, TX. The idea was to make something akin to Brian Eno&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies">Oblique Strategies</a> but more tailored for writers&mdash;a prompt or set of constraints aimed at generating ideas.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-2.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" /></div>

<p>Clicking the &#8220;draw&#8221; button draws the number and type of &#8220;seeds&#8221; specified by the form.</p>

<div class="img-block">
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-3.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" />
  <img class="blockimg" src="/images/seedy-stories/screenshot-4.png" alt="Seedy Stories screenshot" />
</div>

<p>The checkbox by each question toggles the visibility of that column.</p>

<p>John McGrath, who made Wordie.org, which has since merged with or been consumed by <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik.com</a>, wrote a little blog post about it&mdash;noting that our designs both used Palatino. And a user named CherryDaiquiri wrote to me and called it &#8220;the most non-boring thing on the internet&#8221;.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s since fallen into disrepair. I still like the idea. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe the next time I find myself in Denton I&#8217;ll refresh it, rework the design a little, rebrand it in the fashion of <a href="http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/">WTFSIMFD</a>.</p>
