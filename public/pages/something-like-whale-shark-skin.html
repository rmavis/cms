    <h1>Something Like Whale Shark Skin</h1>

<p>A few nights ago we were eating dinner at a restaurant that was playing one of those zen-out ocean movies on the wall. A few of the segments involved whale sharks and I was reminded of how much I like the pattern on their skin.</p>

<p>So I wrote a little <a href="https://github.com/rmavis/whale-shark-skin">Javascript</a> that creates an image-in-code that looks something like it. <a href="http://richardmavis.info/whale-shark-skin">Check it out</a>. Refresh the page a couple times.</p>

<p>Part of what I love about whale shark skin is that the pattern reminds me of the look of plant cells.</p>

<p>And I think it&#8217;s hilarious that the world&#8217;s largest fish looks a little like it&#8217;s covered in tiny plant parts.</p>
