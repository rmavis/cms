    <h1>Syntax and First-Class Functions</h1>

<p>For a few years Ruby has been my language of choice for web and CLI projects. Its conceptual and syntactic integrity (every value is an object, every function is a member of a class, every class is a descendant of the Object class) simplifies the work both of thinking through a problem and of expressing your solution. The simplicity and consistency of its design make thinking and writing in The Ruby Way very easy.</p>

<p>But that way is not quite ideal. In particular, the way Ruby handles first-class functions feels relatively clumsy. Here&#8217;s a contrived situation in which you might want to use first-class functions:</p>

<pre><code>def formal(name)
  &quot;Hello, #{name}.&quot;
end

def informal(name)
  &quot;Howdy, #{name}.&quot;
end

style = (person.familiar?) ? :informal : :formal
Object.send(style, &quot;neighbor&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>And if <code>formal</code> and <code>informal</code> were members of a <code>Greet</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>Greet.send(style, &quot;neighbor&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby requires you to notate the function name that you want to call as a symbol, and then to <code>send</code> that symbol to the object for execution. This adds bad funk to the flow, a small brainfart to the mental model of function-as-variable, by introducing a sort of referent-translation step. You cannot call the variable function directly, as with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>style = informal
Greet.style(&quot;neighbor&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, you pass an encoded version of the function&#8217;s name to a function that decodes that name and then calls that named function for you.</p>

<p>So on one hand, Ruby&#8217;s style is consistent&#8212;every method called on an object must be named directly&#8212;and its consistency is one of Ruby&#8217;s virtues. On the other hand, the process of symbolizing the method name and invoking it with <code>send</code> is less elegant than it could be.</p>

<p>This process of calling a function by a representation of its name is similar to PHP&#8217;s <code>call_user_func</code>.</p>

<pre><code>function formal($name) {
    return &quot;Hello, $name.&quot;;
}

function informal($name) {
    return &quot;Howdy, $name.&quot;;
}

$style = (is_familiar($person)) ? &quot;informal&quot; : &quot;formal&quot;;
call_user_func($style, &quot;neighbor&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>Calling class methods is similar:</p>

<pre><code>call_user_method(&quot;Greet&quot;, $style, &quot;neighbor&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>But, at least as of version <sub>5</sub>.4, PHP allows a different syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$style = &quot;informal&quot;;
$style(&quot;neighbor&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>Greet-&gt;$style(&quot;neighbor&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>Appending parentheses to a variable name is a fine way of calling a variable function. It looks just like an ordinary function call&#8212;there&#8217;s no need to call a global function or to prepend a symbolized function name to the parameter list&#8212;and it introduces no referent-translation step. And there&#8217;s the additional bonus of explicitly indicating an absence of arguments.</p>

<p>This is how first-class functions are called both in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>function informal(name) {
    return &quot;Howdy, &quot; + name + &quot;.&quot;;
}

var style = informal;
style(&quot;neighbor&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>And in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def formal(name):
    return &quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;.&quot;

style = formal
style(&quot;stranger&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>If parentheses triggered function calls in Ruby, rather than only designating parameter lists, then its first-class function-handling would be on par with JavaScript&#8217;s, which is great. Instead, it&#8217;s closer to PHP&#8217;s&#8212;and not even current PHP, but a deprecated version. It pains to me write that.</p>

<p>But the gold standard of simplicity and consistency is Lisp&#8212;any Lisp, but Scheme in particular&#8212;where everything is either an atom or a list, and any atom at the start of a list is treated as a function and any others are arguments to that function.</p>

<pre><code>(define (formal name)
    (string-append &quot;Hello, &quot; name &quot;.&quot;))

(define (informal name)
    (string-append &quot;Howdy, &quot; name &quot;.&quot;))

(define (greet style name)
    (style name))

(greet informal &quot;neighbor&quot;)
</code></pre>
