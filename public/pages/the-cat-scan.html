    <h1>The Cat Scan</h1>

<p>My wife loves cats. She spends a lot of time looking at cats that are up for adoption. A couple years ago she lucked out and found one she was super excited about at the Willamette Humane Society. We drove down to Salem and adopted him that weekend.</p>

<div class="img-block">

  <div class="image-caption">Potential names included: Oppenheimer, Water Bear, Judge Dredd. We compromised on Winston.</div>
</div>

<p>He was the best cat either of us had ever met. He was with us a little over two years before kidney disease killed him.</p>

<p>My wife was pretty upset. Plus, the timing was bad&#8212;he died a few days before her birthday.</p>

</div>

<p>So for her present I wrote her <a href="https://github.com/rmavis/site-scan">a Ruby script</a>. It fetches web pages, reads through them, pulls chunks of information you want, checks that information against values you specify, and emails you any matches.</p>
