    <h1>Tumblr themes</h1>

<p>So I made a few tumblr themes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/12833">Ported</a> was the first. I used it for a long time.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/tumblr-themes/ported.png" alt="Ported theme" /></div>

<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/14503">Loblaw</a> was the second. I made it mostly as a joke. The idea was to resemble a legal document.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/tumblr-themes/loblaw.png" alt="Loblaw theme" /></div>

<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/18318">Trirad</a> was the third. I didn&#8217;t use it for long. It&#8217;s been installed nearly twice as many times as the others.</p>

<div class="img-block"><img class="blockimg" src="/images/tumblr-themes/trirad.png" alt="trirad theme" /></div>

<p>And I never made <a href="http://ported.tumblr.com/">my current theme</a> public. But I like it the best.</p>
