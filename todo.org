- [ ] How to specify a group of related objects in a specific order and by a specific key?
  If a Group is an array, then this type is a hash.
  Can call it a Set.
  A Set maps slugs to objects.
  Or just use a Compound field with a new data type: reference.
  Can refer to things by slugs, file paths, etc?
  Can make the `asset` type a `reference` type. Or can make `local_file` a subclass of the reference type.
  Want to enable content entries like:
  users:
  - adrian
  - benny
  - charles
  And then reference the full objects referenced by those slugs.

  Receiving and validating data, whether that's from a YAML file or an HTML form, is essentially the same process: data comes into a function, that function cycles through and calls all appropriate `validate` methods, collects validated data, and directs it somewhere.
