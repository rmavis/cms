* Todo
** Base [8/12]
- [X] Add dynamic/calculated fields
- [X] Create Templates from YAML files
- [X] Convert Templates to YAML
  Currently the values are not being set properly in compound fields.
  The field's `attrs[:value]` receives the value, but the component fields' `attrs[:value]` remains `nil`. So extracting those values via recursive, consistent calls to `val` are not working.
- [X] When converting Template to YAML, add the `template` key
- [X] Are the `value_type`s even being used?
- [X] Convert Templates to HTML Pages
- [ ] Convert Templates to HTML Forms
- [X] Move field template name into field class as property?
      Could have `page_file` and `form_file`?
      Because assuming filenames / requiring filenames to conform to rules sucks.
- [X] Make the erb variable name easier-working
